Requirements
General
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram

This project will be manually reviewed:

Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (Used imgur)

For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file

After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box

You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session

Focus on what you are being asked:
Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project

Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements

Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
